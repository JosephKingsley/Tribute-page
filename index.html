        <h1 class="title-MR">ABOUT MR. PETER OBI</h1>

        <ul style="list-style: square">
            <li>Peter Obi, the Titan, was born placid on the 19th of July, 1961 at the Holy Rosary Hospital & Maternity, Waterside-Onitsha. Besides their eldest brother that was born in Lagos and the youngest, a peripatetic son born in Obe Maternity, Agulu during the civil war when Onitsha was under siege, all other sibling of his were born in the same hospital. At the time of his birth, his father was already a rich man-owner of Ideal Soul Super-Market, the biggest in the then Eastern Nigeria; while his mother a matron of feminine tenderness was already running what was called “Domestic Centre”, where would-be-married men send their would-be wives for training in acts of domestic economy and matrimonial peace that at that time usually guaranteed happy marriage and fulfilled homes. While undergoing pupilage, they learnt diverse arts: weaving, clothe-making and baking. It was an attractive alternative to the formal education of girls at that time. Part of the major curriculum was ways of ensuring peace in the home and the Matron’s favourite admonition to young ladies was that God gave us two ears to hear more and speak less a veiled lesson for those who, by reckless exercise of the franchise of the tongue, always got themselves into trouble</li>
            <br> 
            <li>One of the acts flowing from Peter Obi’s retrospect into his life is the construction of the ultra-modern maternity building at the hospital of his birth. That singular act has deep significance that transcends the mere erection of a building. Mr. Peter Obi in his usually-measured speech and placid wisdom once confided in me that the act was a way of showing appreciation to one of the institutions that played a critical role in his life, by ensuring his safe ingress into the world. This informs his championing of adoption of schools, rendering help to schools that trained us as part of giving back to the society. He has vastly expanded this very advice through his school apostolate.</li>
            <br>
             <li>Growing up, Obi had the temperament of young ones the world over. Like others, he engaged in child-hood pranks, made friends, attended and danced at parties and also discovered the charms of women. Did he go further than this? What do you want to read from me? All I can inform you now is that he also experienced the sexual and psychological transformation biology calls puberty in his growth process, a time most youngsters have few moral restraints upon desire. But his friends still testify that he gives to friendship the tenderness and solicitude that most men give to love.</li>
             <br>
             <li>During holidays and intervals in his studies he did not spend in play or idleness, as other children do. Even when he attended parties he did not lose himself in such epicurean indulgence for he took time to experiment with one trade or the other. For reigning fashions, he got the local artists to replicate them for sale and making money. In primary school, he sold kerosene. In secondary school, he sold eggs and had commercial taxis plying for him. As an undergraduate, he was already engaged in international business, travelling to London every two weeks and buying brand new vehicles for personal use. All in all, he lived the life that at each level of his development transcended all expectations. He did not remain becalmed in any stage of life.</li>
             <br>
             <li>Sometimes we enquire into the workings of people’s minds not by the battles they fought and lions they killed, but through acts that sometimes appear insignificant as will be told about Obi. Once upon a time, his cousin was wedding and had to borrow the three exclusive vehicles he used from Obi, including the one used by the newly-wedded. As they were going to the Hall for reception, some of his friends passing by saw him flagging down a taxi that would take him to the venue and decided to pick him, but he declined because there was no room left in their car and he would rather continue with his taxi business than inconvenient them. When they could not persuade him to manage with them, one of the girls in the car advised they should ignore him as one ready to remain fixed in his poverty.</li>
             <br>
             <li>When they left, the other boys explained to her that the three vehicles used for the wedding were his. The young girl, unknown to others, smoked out his hotel room, visited him incognito and became his friend. The rest, as is said, is history.</li>
             <br>
             <li>His academic life was intricately woven around his business activities such that after graduation and national youth service, it was a seamless transition into a fully-fledged business life. While others were learning the wisdom of pleasure, he was engrossed in the pleasure of wisdom, which he employed successfully in all that he did. Thus, one of his colleagues, Chief Okey Ezibe described him with awe: “In my business life I am yet to see a businessman like Mr. Peter Obi. One can entrust his entire fortune into his hands and go home and sleep soundly”. When I asked Chief Emma Bishop Okonkwo about Obi’s character, he laughed loudly and burst with compliments: “Val, I give you any amount of credit you need in business simply because Obi requested that. If those of us that know him can trust the person he recommended, that shows you that he is Trust himself”.</li>
             <br>
             <li>What are the secrets of building the type of trust Obi has built over the years? I once referred to him in terms quite Confucian; “the Higher Man”. Recall that when Tsze-Loo asked Confucius, “what constitutes the Higher man?”, he replied, “the cultivation of himself with reverential care”. Obi has cultivated himself along the lines of virtues that describing him is sometimes annoying because of few allowances for the frailty of man. His mother shall partly be blamed for this inclination to sanctity.</li>
             <br>
             <li>To the question of transparency in dealing with people, he would always recall the five words to him by his mother when he was leaving Onitsha to Lagos. Let his mother speak directly: ‘My son, when you get to Lagos, I want you to abide by five canons, namely: do not steal, do not envy anybody of his success, if somebody gives you something to keep return it intact upon request, let prayer be your watchword and keep the 10 commandments as if your life depended on them.</li>
             <br>
             <li>Obi admiringly refused to sell his conscience by doing what most other politicians do. During his contrived impeachment in 2006, many suggestions came from anonymous groups that wanted to be empowered to bring down the State House of Assembly building while the members were sitting, to smite their families as a prelude to them of what would happen to them, but Obi, like President Jonathan would not stand the sight of a soul being lost because of politics, did not play ball.</li>
